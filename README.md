# Vaccine-Managment-Program
This system involves objects like people, personnel members, vaccines, appointments, and vaccination centers. The developed system is GUI-driven which makes it easy to browse. 

This Java program is designed to manage the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to citizens and non-citizens. The program has two types of access rights - one for people and the other for personnel of a special committee.

Personnel of the committee have access to various functionalities, including the ability to register, modify, view, and search for citizens/non-citizens who wish to receive the vaccine. They can also manage vaccination appointments for registered individuals, and add/remove/modify/view/search the supply of COVID-19 vaccines at the center.

People, on the other hand, have access to functionalities such as registering for the vaccination program, submitting vaccination appointment requests, and viewing vaccination status. They can modify their registration details and cancel their appointments if necessary. They can also search for their details if they have already registered.

Overall, this Java program provides a user-friendly interface for both citizens/non-citizens and committee personnel to manage the COVID-19 vaccination program efficiently.
